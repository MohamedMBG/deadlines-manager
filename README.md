# Deadline Manager App

## Overview

The Deadline Manager App is an Android application built using Kotlin that allows users to manage their projects and deadlines efficiently. Users can add, view, and track their projects, complete with titles, descriptions, and deadlines, while visually monitoring their progress through a user-friendly interface. 

**Note**: This project is still a work in progress. I am actively developing it to enhance features and optimize the user experience. The final version will feature a great UI design with an easy and intuitive UX.

## Features

- **User Management**: Users can register and store their information securely.
- **Project Management**: Users can create and manage multiple projects, each with a title, description, and deadline.
- **Progress Tracking**: A visual progress bar shows the time remaining until the project deadline, updating in real-time.
- **Good UI/UX Design**: The application will feature a clean and intuitive user interface, making it easy for users to navigate and manage their projects effectively.
- **Data Persistence**: Utilizes Room database for local data storage, ensuring data is retained across app sessions.

## Tech Stack

- **Kotlin**: The primary programming language for Android development.
- **Android SDK**: The official SDK for Android app development.
- **Room**: A persistence library that provides an abstraction layer over SQLite to allow for more robust database access.
- **Coroutines**: Used for asynchronous programming, allowing for smooth data operations without blocking the UI.
